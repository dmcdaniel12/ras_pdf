# ras_pdf
Ras_Pdf is a Magento 2 module that allows PDF's to be uploaded to the "images" section to display on pages. 

We've used this on a number of clients to allow PDF's to be uploaded. If you'd like to get to know more about what we can do, visit us at www.randomactsstudios.com and contact us.
